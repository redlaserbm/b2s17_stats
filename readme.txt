Some remarks about the data:
- the json file contains an array of all matches
- timestamps (dates) are in unix format
- the timestamps may be inaccurate as the nk api has delays (those change over time) and the bot had some downtime too
- I believe all HoM matches got registered (I don't think the bot's outages were long enough for data to get forgotten by the api)
- some matches here got leaked from zomg arena
- early in the season timestamps were the time the match was registered, then it was changed to the beginning time of the scan that collected them for consistency
